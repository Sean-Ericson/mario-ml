# mario-ml - Playing Mario with Machine Learning

This project was inspired from [Sethbling's excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44) on applying the 
[NEAT (Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroevolution_of_augmenting_topologies) algorithm to play
Super Mario World.

TODO: More details to come here!
